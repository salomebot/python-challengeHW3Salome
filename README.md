Berkeley Data Analytics Homework 3

Pybank
In this challenge, I have created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company. I was given two sets of revenue data (budget_data_1.csv and budget_data_2.csv). Each dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Revenue.
The Python script analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
The total number of months included in the dataset
The total amount of revenue gained over the entire period
The average change in revenue between months over the entire period
The greatest increase in revenue (date and amount) over the entire period
The greatest decrease in revenue (date and amount) over the entire period

This script is be able to handle any such similarly structured dataset in the future and prints the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

Pypoll
I was given two sets of poll data (election_data_1.csv and election_data_2.csv). Each dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. I created a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:
The total number of votes cast
A complete list of candidates who received votes
The percentage of votes each candidate won
The total number of votes each candidate won
The winner of the election based on popular vote.

This script is able to handle any such similarly-structured dataset in the future and prints the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
